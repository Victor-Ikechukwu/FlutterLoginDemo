# Flutter Login Page

A simple, responsive login page built using **Flutter**. This project demonstrates how to build a mobile application with a **login** and **registration** page. The app is designed to be responsive and runs across multiple devices, such as web browsers, Android, and iOS platforms. It also provides an introduction to **Flutter's Material Design** and how to implement UI elements effectively.

## Features

- **Responsive design** that adapts to different screen sizes (mobile and web).
- **Login Page** with validation for email and password.
- **Registration Page** for new users.
- **Forgot Password** functionality (UI only, no backend integration yet).
- **Custom styling** using Flutter's built-in widgets and CSS-like styling for UI elements.
- **Cross-platform**: Can be run on browsers, Android, and iOS devices.
- Basic **form validation** on login and registration.

## Running the Project

### 1. Running on a Web Browser

## Usage

Once the project is running, you will see a **Login Page**. Here’s a summary of how the UI behaves:

- **Login:** Enter an email and password to log in (currently only UI, no backend).
- **Register:** Click on the "Register Now" link to navigate to the registration page. Fill in your details and hit "Register".
- **Forgot Password:** Navigate to the "Forgot Password" section, enter your recovery email, and receive a success message.

Note: No actual backend integration is present yet—this is primarily for UI demonstration.
